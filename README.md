## Project Overview

The Lipstick Recommendation Engine is a React-based web application designed to simplify the decision-making process for consumers in the rapidly expanding lipstick market. This project leverages data-driven insights from YouTube, utilizing a combination of metrics to recommend the top lipstick choices to users.

### Current Problem

- **Market Diversity:** The cosmetic industry, particularly the lipstick segment, has seen a substantial increase in product diversity, presenting consumers with numerous options.
- **Decision Paralysis:** This abundance creates a challenge, leading to overwhelm and uncertainty about the most suitable choices.
- **Information Overload:** Consumers face difficulties due to conflicting information from various online sources, making it hard to make well-informed decisions.

### Proposed Solution

- **Data-Driven Insights:** Our model identifies the ten most sought-after lipstick types by analyzing key metrics from highly viewed YouTube lipstick recommendation videos.
- **Robust Scoring System:** It considers factors such as the frequency of mentions, popularity metrics (likes and subscriber counts), and sentiment analysis of comments to determine product scores.
- **User-Centric Approach:** The platform enables users to refine search criteria using filters like price, benefits, and color preferences, helping them find the best lipsticks.

### Search Engine

- **ReactJS Interface:** Developed using ReactJS, offering a dynamic and responsive user experience.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Users can effortlessly sort and filter lipsticks based on their specific preferences, guided by a scoring system that ranks lipsticks based on their popularity and user feedback.
